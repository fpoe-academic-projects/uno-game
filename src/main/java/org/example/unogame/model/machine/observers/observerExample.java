/**
 * Example implementation of the {@code observer} interface demonstrating basic observer functionality.
 * 
 * <p>This class serves as a concrete example of how to implement the Observer pattern
 * in the context of the Uno game. It provides a simple demonstration of how observers
 * can react to game events by printing messages to the console.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This implementation is primarily intended for:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Educational purposes - showing how to implement the observer interface</li>
 *   <li>Testing the observer pattern implementation</li>
 *   <li>Debugging game events during development</li>
 *   <li>Serving as a template for more complex observer implementations</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>In a production environment, this class would typically be replaced with more
 * sophisticated observers that perform actual game logic operations rather than
 * just printing messages.</p>

     * Handles events by printing a message to the console.
     * 
     * <p>This method demonstrates a simple observer implementation that reacts to
     * game events by outputting information to the console. The message indicates
     * that the machine has played a card on the board, followed by the specific
     * event details.</p>
     * 
     * <p>This is a basic example implementation. In a real application, observers
     * would typically:</p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Update game state based on the event</li>
     *   <li>Trigger UI updates</li>
     *   <li>Perform validation or business logic</li>
     *   <li>Coordinate with other system components</li>
     *   <li>Log events for debugging or analytics</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * @param mensaje the event message describing what occurred in the game
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the message parameter is null
